The goal of this map editor is to create a map for any 2D game that uses 16*16 pixel sized tiles, using provided 16*16 tile images. 

How to use:
- Put any unique tiles you want included in the map in the res/tiles folder. Make sure the image is 16 pixels wide and 16 pixels high.
- Load up the program using any IDE of your choosing.
- The tiles you have put in the tiles folder should now be visible by name in the bottom of the screen, and the grid should be 50*50. You need to change this in the code if you want different grid layout.
- Once selected by clicking the tile you want, you can now insert them at any point in the grid by clicking on it.
- Finish the map, and then save using the save button that should appear in the bottom right next to the set tile buttons.
- Enter the name of the file, it will be saved as .txt by default, so go and change it if you want, or change it in the code (just ctrl + F for ".txt").

NOTE: If the file already exists, the previous file will be OVERWRITTEN instead of copied. Make sure you do not overwrite any of your maps using this by immediately extracting them and putting them somewhere safe.

Enjoy :)

I don't intend for this to be a project I work on a lot. I may work on scaling the GUI a little differently in the future, but I am perfectly fine working with it is as it is now, so it's not a huge priority for me.
What I use it for is creating maps for 2D adventure games where I define the map using text files. 
This is to help visualize the map when creating it, instead of just editing the text file directly, which is also possible, but painful.

Enjoy and use any of my provided assets if you like, they were all hand crafted by me in Paint 3D with inspiration from RyiSnow's tiles on Youtube.
